# Description

üìå Command-Line Calculator (Python)

This project is a modular, professional-grade command-line calculator application built in Python. It emphasizes clean architecture, error handling, testing, and continuous integration with GitHub Actions.

‚ú® Features

- REPL Interface: Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for continuous calculations.

- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulo.

- Calculation Management: Uses a CalculationFactory to create calculation objects and maintains a history of operations.

- Special Commands: help, history, and exit for enhanced user experience.

- Robust Error Handling: Handles invalid input and division/modulo by zero gracefully.

üß™ Testing

- Unit & Parameterized Tests with pytest for all components.

- 100% Test Coverage enforced via pytest-cov and GitHub Actions.

- Coverage Exceptions: Specific unreachable lines (e.g., pass, continue) marked with # pragma: no cover.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow runs tests and checks coverage on every push/PR.

- Test coverage 100%.
